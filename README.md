Sanity.io is a platform for structured content management, often referred to as a headless CMS (Content Management System). It allows developers and content creators to collaborate on managing content for websites, applications, and other digital experiences.

At its core, Sanity.io provides tools for defining content schemas, managing content entries, and delivering content through APIs. It follows a headless architecture, which means it separates the content management backend from the presentation layer, giving developers the flexibility to use any frontend technology or framework they prefer.

Key features of Sanity.io include:

Customizable Content Models: Developers can define custom schemas to structure content according to their project's requirements. This includes defining fields, data types, relationships, and validation rules.

Rich Text Editing: Content creators can use a rich text editor to create and format textual content, including support for features like images, links, and embedded media.

Media Management: Sanity.io provides capabilities for managing media assets, including images, videos, and documents. It supports features like image cropping, resizing, and optimization.

Version Control: Sanity.io tracks revisions of content entries, providing a history of changes and allowing users to revert to previous versions if needed.

APIs for Content Delivery: Content stored in Sanity.io can be accessed via APIs, which allows developers to retrieve content and integrate it into their applications or websites.

Developer-Friendly Tools: Sanity.io offers developer-friendly tools and APIs, making it easy to integrate with existing workflows and systems. It provides SDKs for various programming languages and frameworks.
